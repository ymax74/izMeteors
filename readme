Introduction:  
Over the past decade, we have witnessed the rapid growth of meteor event detection systems operating in the optical bandpass, along with the development of corresponding databases. These databases provide results from raw data analysis, which includes video streams or consecutive image frames. They offer detailed information on individual meteor events, such as the time of occurrence and positions on the celestial sphere, as well as insights that can be derived from a set of individual event data, including radiant evolution, ZHR, and orbital parameters.
Perhaps the most well-known meteor camera network is the Global Meteor Network (GMN, https://globalmeteornetwork.org/) [1]. One of the main advantages of the GMN database is a special Python code for data access. The GMN data are extracted from globally distributed small cameras with an angular scale of about ten of arcmins per pixel. This decreases the final data accuracy and applicability to the set of meteor astronomy problems. There are several similar types of data sources that are available at the Meteor Data Center (MDC) of the IAU (https://www.iaumeteordatacenter.org/), usually as plain text (sometimes as CSV) tables. A significant improvement in the accuracy and availability of faint meteor data was demonstrated by the Mini-MegaTORTORA (MMT, http://mmt.favor2.info/) system [2]. Here, we see simple text tables for different nights and some visualization of individual events.
The natural data set traditionally available from numbered databases usually includes RA and DEC for starting and final points, angular velocity, and minimal and maximal brightness. However, for a significant part of the modern applications, a set of sequential event images is required. Here we present the meteor event detection network izMeteors and the corresponding database (https://izmeteors.ru/, and a mirror at izmeteors.puldb.ru). Our database provides access to both traditional meteor event data and a compressed image set, which is one of the main advantages of our data product.
izMeteors meteor event detection network:  
Our meteor event detection network relies on intermediate optics. This approach avoids very short focal length lenses, which have an angular scale of approximately 10 arcmins per pixel. The frame field of view is 50 x 30 degrees with a scale of 3 arcmin/pix. The fundamental pipeline for event detection is outlined in papers [3] and [4], with partial availability on GitHub (https://github.com/ymax74/szm). The link http://sfa.puldb.ru:9010/MetObs/AssyTurgen/MetVideo/m2025x05x24T20h17m34s.mp4 demonstrates the typical set of frames for the event.
Our meteor monitoring network was established one year ago. The cameras are located at Pulkovo Observatory (59.771771, 30.326226), Zlobino station (55.414497, 41.554068), Ka-Dar Observatory (43.652548, 41.428386), and Assy-Turgen Observatory of the V.G. Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute (FAI) of the National Center for Space Research and Technology under the Aerospace Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan (43.227172, 77.872787). Additionally, this high-altitude observatory is home to the Pulkovo 40-cm telescope and the WFOS-40 telescope, designed by FAI specialists.
A distinctive feature of the network is the complete automation of work and the minimization of the efforts of observatory engineers to maintain equipment. The video stream analysis from the cameras is conducted using energy-efficient computers running Windows 10 in real time. 
The video feed from Astroverty astrofarm cameras was analyzed simultaneously using software developed for the GMN network and the izMeteor pipeline. It turned out that izMeteor reliably detects about 1.5 times more meteor phenomena.
Conclusions:  
The izMeteors network (https://izmeteors.ru/) has been constructed at the IAA RAS and the Pulkovo Observatory. Data on 60,000 individual meteor events are currently available. The system collects 500-1000 events each night. Alongside the standard data set for each event, compressed image sets are available. This data can be utilized for reprocessing and training neural networks to identify the characteristics of meteor events. For instance, meteor phenomena caused by cometary particles can exhibit different behaviors compared to those caused by meteoroids that have been ejected from asteroid surfaces when they enter the atmosphere.
